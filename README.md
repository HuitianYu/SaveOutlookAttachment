This is a macro module written in Visual Basic Application to allow download the attachments from the mail server to local storage and replace the attachment by an HTML file linking to the local attachment in the e-mail. 
It is ideal if the storage of the server is limited. It also provides approach to handle e-mails with signatures (i.e. signed e-mails cannot be excuted with other e-mails).

You can import this module into Outlook macros to activate this functionby first activating the developer tool (File --> Options --> Customize Ribbon --> Customize the Ribbon --> Main Tabs --> Developer) and add a quick access at the top of window.

Usage:
1. Select all the emails with attachments you want to replace with HTML links
2. Execute the macro module or click the correspondent quick access button
3. All the attachments without signature will be replaced.
4. A warning will show how many attachments with signatures will remain unreplaced.
5. Click for each time one signed e-mail with attachments, because it will ask you for permission to excute the replacement.

You are welcome to use the tool and give me feedback about it. I am glad if you will fork this project and improve the tool upon mine. No commercial used is allowed. Other public demonstration requires my permission.
